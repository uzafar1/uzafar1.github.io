            My name is Uraiba Zafar. For as long as I can remember, I have always loved fashion. It is the way in which I express myself, and how I claim my individuality. I grew up watching my mother repurpose her old clothes into little mini versions for me. I remember going to visit fabric stores with her, picking out the right weight and texture of the fabric and feeling like I could wander around in there forever.

        Education and Early Career
    </h3>
    <p>
    I got my undergraduate degree in Fashion from The Ohio State University. I was surprised to learn that Columbus, OH is actually the third largest hub of fashion companies in the country, falling only behind NYC and LA. One of the companies that calls Columbus home is Abercrombie & Fitch. I was recruited to work for them while in college, and continued on in my career in fashion with them for 4 years.

    <h3>
        Personal Style
        </h3>
    <p>
        I have a very dynamic personal style, I like to switch up what I wear often and am privy to try new trends, but overarching I would say my style is pretty classic. I have diligently built a strong staple wardrobe and like to expand from there. Having a solid pair of blue denim, white denim, black denim in addition to a plain white tshirt and a plain white button down, that right there can combine to make over 10 outfits.
